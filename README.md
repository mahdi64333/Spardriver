# Spardriver

A basic Deep Reinforcement Learning agent and environment for driving in a 4 lane highway made with keras.

You can run the ``spardriver_env.py`` and play the game by arrow keys without the agent to get a sense of what's going on.

It is possible to train the agent based on pre existing network so the previous data will not be thrown away.
